## The project title
COVID vaccination booster trends - Understanding geographic and socioeconomic trends
 
## The motivation for this project
Our hope is to examine COVID-19 booster vaccination trends for certain age groups in NYC, focusing on a few specific time points, and investigate potential associations with geographic and socioeconomic variables. We will assess trends at the borough and zip-code levels.
 
## The intended final products
At this stage, we anticipate working on the following:

- Evaluate and select useful variables from the links below.
- Present information on zip code / borough distribution of booster.
- Use functions such as ggplot to visualize our chosen variables of interest.
- Create a website on github with the results of our work. 
 
## The anticipated data sources
 -  NYC COVID Vaccine Data:  https://github.com/nychealth/covid-vaccine-data 
 - NYC Demographics by Zipcode: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Demographic-Statistics-By-Zip-Code/kku6-nxdu 

## The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges
